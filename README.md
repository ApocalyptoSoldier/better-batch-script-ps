# BetterBatch
A transpiler for batch files to overcome the limitations of the Batch scripting language.
Itself transpiled from https://github.com/konalt/better-batch-script from JavaScript to PowerShell to remove the dependance on Node.js
## Why?
Batch has been limited by many things ever since its creation. This changes that.
## How to use this?
Simply run `.\Compile-BBS [filename]` from the command line, where you have your batch file.
## The syntax
Syntax is in [SYNTAX.md](https://github.com/ApocalyptoSoldier/better-batch-script-ps/blob/main/SYNTAX.md).
